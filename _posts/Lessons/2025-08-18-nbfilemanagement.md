## Lesson 1: Jupyter Notebooks & JavaScript

### Introduction

This lesson explores the integration of JavaScript within Jupyter Notebooks, a powerful combination for interactive data exploration and web development. We will cover how to execute JavaScript code directly within Jupyter cells and manage related files within a GitHub Pages environment.

### Running JavaScript in Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks, while primarily known for Python, can execute various languages through kernels. For JavaScript, this typically involves using an IJavaScript kernel or leveraging the `%%javascript` magic command in a standard Python kernel environment, which allows for direct execution of JavaScript code within a cell. This capability is particularly useful for front-end development tasks, interactive visualizations, or integrating web-based components into data analysis workflows.

To execute JavaScript in a Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1.  **Open Developer Tools:** In Visual Studio Code (VSCode), navigate to `Help > Toggle Developer Tools`. This action opens the developer console, which is crucial for observing JavaScript output, as `console.log()` statements will appear here.
2.  **Access the Console:** Within the Developer Tools window, select the `Console` tab. This tab displays all console outputs, errors, and warnings generated by the JavaScript code.
3.  **Clear Console (Optional):** To ensure a clean output for your current execution, click the `Clear Console` button (represented by a circle with a line through it).
4.  **Execute Code:** Locate the Jupyter cell containing your JavaScript code and click the `Play button` to the left of the cell. The JavaScript code will execute, and any `console.log()` outputs will be visible in the Developer Tools console.

### Example: Interactive Jokes Application

Consider an example where JavaScript is used to display random jokes. This demonstrates how to define arrays of data and use basic JavaScript functions to interact with that data. The following code snippets illustrate the structure for both programmer and accountant jokes.

#### Programmer Jokes

This example uses an array of JavaScript objects, where each object contains a joke and a complexity rating. This structure allows for more complex data representation and manipulation.

```javascript
%%javascript

var compsci_joke_list = [
    { joke: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.", complexity: "1" },
    { joke: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don\'t see sharp.", complexity: "2" },
    { joke: "How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that\'s a hardware problem.", complexity: "1" },
    { joke: "Why do Python programmers prefer snake_case? Because they can\'t C.", complexity: "2" },
    { joke: "Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn\'t know how to \'null\' his feelings.", complexity: "3" },
    { joke: "Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25.", complexity: "3" },
    { joke: "Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn\'t get arrays.", complexity: "O(n)" },
    { joke: "Why do Linux programmers prefer using the terminal? Because they don\'t like Windows.", complexity: "1" },
];
var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * compsci_joke_list.length);
var selectedJoke = compsci_joke_list[randomIndex];
console.log("Joke #" + (randomIndex + 1) + ": " + selectedJoke.joke + " (Complexity: " + selectedJoke.complexity + ")");
```

#### Accountant Jokes

This simpler example uses a basic array of strings, demonstrating a straightforward approach to storing and accessing textual data.

```javascript
%%javascript

var accounting_joke_list = [
    "Why did the accountant cross the road? To bore the people on the other side.",
    "What do accountants do when they\'re constipated? They work it out with a pencil.",
    "How does an accountant stay out of debt? He learns to act his wage.",
    "Why did the accountant stare at his glass of orange juice for three hours? Because on the box it said \'concentrate\'.",
    "Why did the accountant get promoted? Because he knew how to balance his work and play.",
    "Why did the accountant get a job at the bakery? Because he was good at making dough.",
    "Why did the accountant get a job at the zoo? Because he was good with cheetahs.",
    "Why did the accountant get a job at the library? Because he was good at keeping books.",
    "Why did the accountant get a job at the circus? Because he was good at juggling numbers.",
    "Why did the accountant get a job at the gym? Because he was good at working out the numbers.",
    "Why did the accountant get a job at the farm? Because he was good at counting the chickens before they hatched."
]
var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * accounting_joke_list.length);
console.log("Joke #" + (randomIndex + 1) + ": " + accounting_joke_list[randomIndex]);
```

### File Management in GitHub Pages

When working with Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub Pages, effective file management is crucial for organizing your content and ensuring proper deployment. The `_notebooks` directory is the designated location for all `.ipynb` files. These files are processed by the GitHub Pages build system, often converted to Markdown (`.md`) and then to HTML for web display.

To integrate your Jupyter Notebooks into a GitHub Pages repository:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone` to copy the GitHub Pages repository to your local machine.
2.  **Pull Latest Changes:** If you already have the repository, use `git pull` to ensure your local copy is up-to-date.
3.  **Open in VSCode:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and use `code .` to open the project in VSCode.
4.  **Drag and Drop Files:** Move your `.ipynb` files into the `_notebooks` directory within your cloned repository. Ensure they are placed in the correct subfolders if your project has a specific structure.

### Best Practices for Jupyter Notebooks in GitHub Pages

*   **Organization:** Keep your `.ipynb` files well-organized within the `_notebooks` directory. Consider creating subdirectories for different topics or projects.
*   **Frontmatter:** For proper processing by Jekyll (the static site generator used by GitHub Pages), ensure your `.ipynb` files include frontmatter. This metadata, typically in YAML format, defines properties like permalinks and layouts.
*   **Conversion:** Understand that Jupyter Notebooks are converted to Markdown and then HTML. While you write in Python or JavaScript within the notebook, the final output on GitHub Pages will be static HTML.
*   **Testing Locally:** Before pushing changes to your GitHub repository, test your GitHub Pages site locally to ensure all notebooks are rendered correctly and links are functional.

### Conclusion

Integrating JavaScript with Jupyter Notebooks in a GitHub Pages environment provides a versatile platform for creating interactive web content and sharing computational narratives. By understanding the execution process and file management best practices, you can effectively leverage these tools for your AP Computer Science Advanced projects.
