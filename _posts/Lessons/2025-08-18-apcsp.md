## üß© Unit-by-Unit Breakdown

### Unit 1: Digital Information
- **Key Ideas**
  - Binary (base 2), bits/bytes
  - Lossless vs. lossy compression
  - Representing text, images, audio
- **Vocabulary**
  - Bit, Byte, Overflow error, Round-off error, Sampling
- **Practice Q**
  - Q: What is the main difference between lossy and lossless compression?
    - ‚úÖ Answer: Lossless preserves all data; lossy discards some data to save space.

---

### Unit 2: The Internet
- **Key Ideas**
  - IP addresses (IPv4 vs IPv6)
  - DNS, TCP/IP, Packets
  - Cybersecurity basics (encryption, HTTPS, phishing)
- **Vocabulary**
  - Bandwidth, Latency, Protocol, Fault tolerance
- **Practice Q**
  - Q: What protocol guarantees delivery of data packets?
    - ‚úÖ Answer: TCP

---

### Unit 3: Algorithms & Programming
- **Key Ideas**
  - Variables, conditionals, iteration
  - Procedures with parameters
  - Searching (linear, binary) & sorting algorithms
- **Vocabulary**
  - Abstraction, Algorithm, Selection, Iteration, Efficiency
- **Practice Q**
  - Q: What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    - ‚úÖ Answer: A parameter is defined in the procedure; an argument is the value passed in.

---

### Unit 4: Big Data & Privacy
- **Key Ideas**
  - Data collection, storage, analysis
  - Moore‚Äôs Law
  - Encryption (symmetric vs asymmetric)
- **Vocabulary**
  - Metadata, Public key encryption, Digital certificate
- **Practice Q**
  - Q: Why is metadata valuable in large datasets?
    - ‚úÖ Answer: It provides context about data (time, source, etc.), enabling deeper analysis.

---

### Unit 5: Impacts of Computing
- **Key Ideas**
  - Digital divide
  - Bias in computing
  - Intellectual property & ethics
- **Vocabulary**
  - Crowdsourcing, Open source, Digital divide, Creative Commons
- **Practice Q**
  - Q: What is the "digital divide"?
    - ‚úÖ Answer: The unequal access to computing resources across different groups.

---

## üìì Essential Vocabulary
- **Abstraction** ‚Äî Reducing complexity by hiding details.
- **Algorithm** ‚Äî A set of instructions to solve a problem.
- **API** ‚Äî A collection of commands/functions made available to a programmer.
- **Iteration** ‚Äî Repeating a set of instructions (loops).
- **Packet** ‚Äî Small chunk of data sent over a network.
- **Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption** ‚Äî Single key vs. public/private key pairs.
- **Heuristic** ‚Äî Problem-solving approach that finds an approximate solution when exact solution is impractical.

---


## ‚úçÔ∏è FRQ Practice & Strategy
- **Tips**
  - Always explain reasoning in words + pseudocode.
  - Define procedures with parameters clearly.
  - Trace through code to predict outputs.




---

## üéØ MCQ Practice Tips
- Eliminate obvious wrong answers first.
- Watch out for **off-by-one errors** in iteration.
- If you see ‚Äúmost efficient,‚Äù think **binary search, sorting, or abstraction**.
- Cybersecurity questions often ask about **encryption or fault tolerance**.

---

## üìÖ Exam Day Advice
- Sleep well ‚Äî don‚Äôt cram last minute.
- Use the **reference sheet** for pseudocode (provided by College Board).
- Manage time: ~1.7 min per MCQ.
- For FRQs, focus on **clarity, not fancy code**.
