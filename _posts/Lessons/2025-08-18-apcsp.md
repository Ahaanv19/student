##  Essential Vocabulary
- **Abstraction** — Reducing complexity by hiding details.
- **Algorithm** — A set of instructions to solve a problem.
- **API** — A collection of commands/functions made available to a programmer.
- **Iteration** — Repeating a set of instructions (loops).
- **Packet** — Small chunk of data sent over a network.
- **Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption** — Single key vs. public/private key pairs.
- **Heuristic** — Problem-solving approach that finds an approximate solution when exact solution is impractical.

---


##  FRQ Practice & Strategy
- **Tips**
  - Always explain reasoning in words + pseudocode.
  - Define procedures with parameters clearly.
  - Trace through code to predict outputs.




---

##  MCQ Practice Tips
- Eliminate obvious wrong answers first.
- Watch out for **off-by-one errors** in iteration.
- If you see “most efficient,” think **binary search, sorting, or abstraction**.
- Cybersecurity questions often ask about **encryption or fault tolerance**.

---

##  Exam Day Advice
- Sleep well — don’t cram last minute.
- Use the **reference sheet** for pseudocode (provided by College Board).
- Manage time: ~1.7 min per MCQ.
- For FRQs, focus on **clarity, not fancy code**.
