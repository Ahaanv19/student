## Lesson 3: Jekyll Themes

### Introduction

Jekyll themes provide a powerful way to quickly style and structure your GitHub Pages website without extensive CSS coding. This lesson delves into how Jekyll themes work, how to switch between them, and how to troubleshoot common issues, enabling you to effectively manage your site\"s visual presentation.

### Understanding Jekyll Themes

A Jekyll theme is a collection of layouts, includes, stylesheets, and scripts that define the look and feel of your website. When you apply a theme, Jekyll uses these files to render your content consistently across all pages. This modular approach allows for rapid development and easy customization.

Key aspects of Jekyll themes include:

*   **Layouts:** These are HTML files (e.g., `default.html`, `page.html`, `post.html`) that provide the overall structure for different types of content. Your content is injected into these layouts.
*   **Includes:** Reusable HTML snippets (e.g., headers, footers, navigation menus) that can be inserted into layouts or other pages.
*   **Assets:** CSS, JavaScript, and image files that control the visual design and interactivity.
*   **Configuration:** Theme-specific settings often defined within your `_config.yml` file or within the theme\"s own configuration files.

### Theme Switching Guide

Switching between Jekyll themes involves modifying your `_config.yml` file and ensuring that the necessary theme files are correctly referenced. The process can be simplified using scripts or by directly editing the configuration.

#### Direct Theme Switching

To switch themes directly, you typically modify the `remote_theme` setting in your `_config.yml` file. For example, to switch from `minima` to `TeXt`:

```yaml
# _config.yml

# To use Minima theme:
# remote_theme: jekyll/minima
# minima:
#   skin: dark

# To use TeXt theme:
remote_theme: kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme
text_theme:
  type: website
  skin: dark
  highlight_theme: tomorrow-night
  lang: en
```

After modifying `_config.yml`, it is often necessary to clean your Jekyll build cache and rebuild the site to ensure the new theme is applied correctly. This can typically be done using `make clean && make` if you have a Makefile configured for your project.

#### Interactive Theme Switching (Advanced)

For more complex projects or for development environments, you might use scripts to automate theme switching. This often involves maintaining separate configuration files for each theme (e.g., `_config.minima.yml`, `_config.text.yml`) and a script that copies the desired configuration to `_config.yml`.

For example, a `switch-theme.sh` script might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

THEME=$1

if [ \"$THEME\" == \"minima\" ]; then
  cp _config.minima.yml _config.yml
  echo \"Switched to Minima theme.\"
elif [ \"$THEME\" == \"text\" ]; then
  cp _config.text.yml _config.yml
  echo \"Switched to TeXt theme.\"
else
  echo \"Usage: ./scripts/switch-theme.sh [minima|text]\"
  exit 1
fi

make clean && make
```

This script would be executed from your terminal: `./scripts/switch-theme.sh minima` or `./scripts/switch-theme.sh text`.

### Theme Features (Minima vs. TeXt)

Different themes offer distinct features and design philosophies. Here\"s a comparison of two popular Jekyll themes:

| Feature             | Minima Theme                               | TeXt Theme                                     |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Design**          | Clean, minimal                             | Modern iOS 11-inspired                         |
| **Dark Mode**       | Supported                                  | Supported (6 built-in skins)                   |
| **Loading Speed**   | Fast                                       | Optimized                                      |
| **Sub-themes**      | Multiple (dracula, leaf, hacker)           | N/A (uses skins)                               |
| **Responsiveness**  | Mobile responsive                          | Mobile responsive                              |
| **Search**          | Basic                                      | Advanced search functionality                  |
| **Math/Diagrams**   | Limited                                    | MathJax & Mermaid diagram support              |
| **Table of Contents** | No built-in                                | Yes                                            |
| **Internationalization** | No built-in                                | Yes                                            |

### Troubleshooting Theme Issues

When encountering issues with Jekyll themes, consider the following diagnostic steps:

1.  **Missing SASS Variables:** If a theme (like TeXt) expects specific SASS files or variables that are not present in your local `_sass` folder, you may need to create them or ensure your theme installation is complete.
2.  **Build Errors:** Often, a `make clean && make` (or `bundle exec jekyll build` if not using a Makefile) command can resolve build errors by clearing the cache and rebuilding the site from scratch.
3.  **Theme Not Switching:** Verify that your `_config.yml` file has been correctly updated with the new `remote_theme` setting. Incorrect paths or typos can prevent the theme from loading.
4.  **Backup:** Always back up your `_config.yml` file before making significant changes. Many theme switching scripts automatically create backups (e.g., `_config.backup.yml`) to facilitate reverting changes if needed.

### Conclusion

Jekyll themes are a powerful asset for creating visually appealing and functional GitHub Pages sites. By understanding their structure, how to switch between them, and effective troubleshooting techniques, you can leverage themes to enhance your web development projects and focus more on content creation rather than intricate design details.
